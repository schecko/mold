	behaviour: Should create an obj file named sphere.obj in the current working directory.
		The sphere should have a radius of 0.5 units.

$ mold box
	behaviour: Should create an obj file named box.obj in the current working directory.
		The box should have an edge length of 1.0 units

$ mold --rotate 30 30 30 box
	behaviour: Should create an obj file named box.obj in the current working directory.
		The box should have an edge length of 1.0 units, and be rotated on all axis by 30 degrees.
		TODO should radius be the default? If so, should the notation for degrees be 30d in this example?
	alternate syntax:
		$ mold -r 30 30 30 box

$ mold --translate 1 2 3 box
	behaviour: Should create an obj file named box.obj in the current working directory.
		The box should be translated to the coordinates <x> <y> <z>.
	alternate syntax:
		$ mold -t 1 2 3 box

$ mold sphere --latitude 3 --longitude 3
	behaviour: Should create an obj file named sphere in the current working directory.
		The granularity of the sphere will be 3 rects down and 3 rects across.
